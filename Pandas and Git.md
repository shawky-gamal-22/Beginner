- Which of the following is a function in NumPy used for carrying out Einstein summations?

    - [ ]  `np.tensordot()`
    - [ ] ¬†`np.dot()`
    - [x] ¬†`np.einsum()`
    - [ ] ¬†`np.outer()`

- The `np.outer` function is primarily intended for:

    - [ ] ¬†Computing the tensor dot product of two arrays.
    - [x] ¬†Computing the outer product of two arrays.
    - [ ] ¬†Computing the inner product of two arrays.
    - [ ] ¬†Computing the cross product of two arrays.

- What do you know about `np.random.randn()`? And how does it depend on `np.random.seed()`?

`np.random.randn()` creates an array of specified size and fill it with real numbers

`np.random.seed()`  makes the random numbers predictable.look for this

``` pyhon
>>> numpy.random.seed(0)
>>> numpy.random.rand(4)
#the output
array([ 0.55,  0.72,  0.6 ,  0.54])
```
And if we run this again it will produce the same output.
but if we change the number in the seed function it will change the output
``` python
>>> numpy.random.rand(4)
#the output
array([ 0.42,  0.65,  0.44,  0.89])
```
